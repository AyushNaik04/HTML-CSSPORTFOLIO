            <h2>Queen Marika and the lands between </h2>
            <hr/>
            <p>Queen Marika the Eternal is the divine ruler of the Lands Between in Elden Ring, chosen by the Greater Will to be the vessel of the Elden Ring. She is a complex figure, sharing her body with her male counterpart Radagon and giving birth to powerful demigods like Malenia, Miquella, Mohg, and Morgott. Marika shattered the Elden Ring in a mysterious act of rebellion, plunging the realm into chaos and triggering the war known as the Shattering. As punishment, she was imprisoned within the Erdtree. The Lands Between, once unified under her rule, is now a fractured world with warring demigods and decaying order. The player, a Tarnished, is called to mend or reshape this broken world and determine Marika’s ultimate legacy.

            <h2>The lands between </h2>
            <hr>
            <p>"Lands Between" is a term from the video game Elden Ring, referring to the game's world. It's a vast and diverse landmass with varied biomes, from lush grasslands to a frozen, mountainous north, all dominated by the Erdtree. The name "Lands Between" is intentionally ambiguous, meant to evoke a sense of mystery and serve as an invitation to explore this new world. </p>

            <h2>Ranni the witch</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Ranni the Witch is a key figure in Elden Ring, known for her intelligence, independence, and defiance of the Greater Will. A demigod daughter of Queen Rennala and Radagon, Ranni rejects her divine fate and instead seeks to bring about a new order. She orchestrates the Night of the Black Knives, leading to the death of Godwyn the Golden, and discards her mortal body to house her spirit in a doll resembling her mentor, Renna. Throughout the game, she guides the player through her mysterious questline, ultimately offering an alternative to the existing power structures. Choosing her path leads to the Age of Stars ending, where Ranni becomes a cosmic ruler, ushering in an era of freedom, mystery, and distant exploration beyond the influence of the Greater Will.

            <h2>Godfrey the First Elden Lord</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Godfrey, the First Elden Lord, was the first consort of Queen Marika and the original bearer of the Elden Ring’s power. Once a mighty warrior named Hoarah Loux, he became the Elden Lord after being chosen by Marika and the Greater Will to lead the Lands Between. Known for his unmatched strength and loyalty, he waged brutal wars to unify the realm and fathered demigods like Morgott and Mohg. However, once his purpose was fulfilled and enemies were vanquished, he was stripped of grace and exiled, becoming the first Tarnished. His exile marked the beginning of the Tarnished's journey. Godfrey later returns, reclaiming his warrior spirit, to challenge the Erdtree once more, representing the Tarnished’s struggle to reclaim lost glory and forge a new order.
